Why I Found It Interesting

This article explains why writing clear and structured commit messages is an important software engineering skill. In real software projects, many developers collaborate on the same codebase, and commit history become a key tool for understanding what changed and why.

I found it especially interesting that good commit messages help with teamwork, debugging, and long-term maintenance. Since software engineering is not only about writing code but also about managing complexity over time, practices like this make development more reliable and professional..
